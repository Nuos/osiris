# Osiris

### What is this?

Osiris is a set of XNA 4.0 Content Pipeline extensions. At the time of writing, Osiris contains:

* A GeoMipMapping Terrain Processor. It is applied to a bitmap containing height data, and will generate
  all the data required for geomipmapping. At runtime, use the TerrainComponent to manage level of detail.
* A TIFF texture importer.
* A RAW texture importer.
